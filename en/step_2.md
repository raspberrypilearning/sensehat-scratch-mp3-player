Choose a sprite for your MP3 player â€” in this example, the sprite is a speaker.

Now you're all set up, you can begin to make your MP3 player by creating a disco effect on the display.

Begin by adding a `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, and then add a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block below it.
```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Find the `set pixel`{:class="block3extensions"} block in the Sense HAT extension.
Put numbers into the `x`{:class="block3extensions"} and`y`{:class="block3extensions"} fields, and change the colour in the `to`{:class="block3extensions"} field:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
+set pixel x (3) y (5) to [#ffffff]:: extension
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Test your code. 

Click on the green flag, and you should see the colour of the pixel at (3,5) on the Sense HAT go white.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Change the pixel position and colour to be random using the `random`{:class="block3operators"} block.

Make sure the numbers in your code match the ones here:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
+set pixel x (pick random (0) to (7)) y (pick random (0) to (7)) to (pick random (-100000) to (100000)) ::extension
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Test your code. 

Click on the green flag to try running your program. You should see the LEDs on the Sense HAT begin to randomly sparkle.
