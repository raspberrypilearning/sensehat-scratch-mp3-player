## What can you do now?

Now that you have completed the 'SenseHAT Mp3 Player' project, try [the 'Santa Detector' project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/santa-detector), which uses a low-cost infrared sensor to set off an alarm when Santa sneaks into your room!

Or, you can have a look at the [Physical Computing with Scratch Pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/physical-computing-with-scratch-and-the-raspberry-pi), where you will make input and output electronics with Scratch and your Raspberry Pi computer!
